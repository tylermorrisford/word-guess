// log users guess on the page, decrement the remaining guesses
// check users guess against the object
// if users guess exists in the object, replace underscore with that letter
// if users guest does not exist on the page, decrement the remaining guesses (optional show and alert saying 'this word does not contain 'userguess')
// if user guesses all letters before running out of guesses, show congratulations alert, and move to the next word
